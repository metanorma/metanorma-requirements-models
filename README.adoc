= The Metanorma Requirements Models

The http://metanorma.com[Metanorma] markup scheme for Standards incorporates requirements in its information model.
This repository presents the model used to capture requirements, for use both in standards document markup,
and as standalone machine-readable artefacts.

== Information Model

=== Top level containers
requirement:: A statement of something that MUST apply (in the RFC 2119). (_Note that "requirement"
is also used generically in this description, to refer to any formal statement of obligation_.)
recommmendation:: A statement of something that SHOULD apply (in the RFC 2119).
permission:: A statement of something that MAY apply (in the RFC 2119).

Requirements can contain other requirments.

=== Attributes and Elements
obligation:: An attribute that may be used to override the obligation represented in the tag name of the 
top level containers. Legal values are `requirement`, `recommendation`, `permission`, and can be
comma-delimited.
title:: Human-readable title of the requirement.
label:: Formal identifier with which the requirement is referenced.
subject:: The party subject to the obligation stated in the requirement.
inherit:: Reference to the label of another requirement, of which this requirement is a subclass, and from which it inherits attributes.
classification:: Key/Value pairs of metadata used to describe the requirement. A key can be associated with multiple values.

=== Sub-Containers
description:: Descriptive statement of the content of the requirement. Is expected to be human-readable,
and to contain formatting markup following Metanorma conventions. Is expected to be discursive, and be
resumed after interruption by other sub-containers.
specification:: Formal specification of the requirement. Is expected to be machine-readable.
verification:: Processes or code used to verify that the requirement is being complied with. Can be a test (including test code), or a compliance statement.
import:: A reference to source code or a statement of prerequisites which is defined elsewhere.
measurement-target:: Quantitative statement of metrics that the requirement realises.
references:: A list of references for the requirement, following the https://github.com/metanorma/relaton-models[Relaton bibliographic model] of Metanorma

Any subcontainer can be either machine-readable or human-readable, or a mixture of the two.
The expectation is that any machine-readable component will be marked up as sourcecode,
following Metanorma conventions (including nominating the programming language.)

== Sub-Container Attributes
type:: A token used to classify sub-containers. For example, a `verification[@type = "unit-test"]` contains a unit test of a single feature, and is to be treated differently from `verification[@type = "comprehensive"]`, which represents a comprehensive test suite.
exclude:: Indicates that the current sub-container is only intended to be machine-readable, and is not to be rendered in the document output of Metanorma.

== Example

Several examples of Machine Readable Requirements encoded in Metanorma are available at
