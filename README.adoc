https://www.metanorma.org[Metanorma] supplies a predefined set of information
models for the encoding of machine-readable requirements.

== Scope

This repository provides the definitions of requirement models supported by
Metanorma.

These models are used for:

* Encoding machine-readable requirements in Metanorma standards
* Reference for Metanorma users who wish to understand these models when used in
  Metanorma syntax
* Export of machine-readable requirements

Metanorma supports usage of the following requirement models:

. Metanorma requirement models
. OGC modular specification models (OGC ModSpec)

== Modelling

=== General

A standard or specification generally contains a set of requirements that apply
to a subject. The value of a machine-readable or machine-interpretable
requirement is the ability to allow a machine to perform validation (or commonly
called, a "test") of that requirement to determine compliance.

These models (a "requirement models suite") commonly include the following:

* a "requirement" model
* a "conformance test" model
* a collection specification mechanism such as:
** "requirements class" which describes the common motivation of a set of
  requirements
** "conformance test class" that describes the common motivation, or a set of
  coherent features, amongst a set of tests

Various suites support slightly different primitives and have slightly different
semantics.

[example]
The OGC ModSpec supports requirement parts, test parts and hierarchical test
steps.

[example]
The Metanorma requirement models support encoding of machine-executable code
within a requirement.
